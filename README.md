# uconv

A general purpose unit-conversion CLI tool. uconv is analogous to the the google search  unit conversion tool only that it is used in your favourite terminal and save you the stress of going to the browsers to get some conversion done for you.

It helps you focus by staying in the terminal and maintain your productivity. It takes input with flags and converts the given input into units like temperature in Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin, length in feet and meters, weight in pounds and kilograms, and the likes.
